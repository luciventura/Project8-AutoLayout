# Project8-AutoLayout
Project 8 from 100DaysOfSwift
On this project I created a game for iPads, using Auto Layout.
Most of it were made by following the tutorial, but there were some challenges:
Draw a thin gray line around the butons view;
Create an extension to the submitTapped(), so the game shows an error message every time the player tries the wrong word;
Make the player loses score every time they input the wrong answer.
